# Document Generator

## Description

Generates a static website with documentation for a set of c source files


## General Ideas

Config file?
Should accept some flags and arguments

## Syntax ideas

@@ should be used to set attributes e.g @@param @@name -- Maybe a function thing only
Structs, enums and defines should be included in their own areas
Files should also have an overview page (Maybe a description of the file then hyperlinks to the relevant data)

## Command ideas
new:
    Arguments:
        1. The directory where the source files are located (A basic check to see if there is atleast 1 file with a .c/.h extension)
        2. The directory to store the html files and other things that may appear (So a general docs file where the program can create it's own directories)

    Flags:
        -no-css; Doesn't import the css file in case the user wants to use a custom one

    Description:
        Creates a default config file for the user to edit before using the regen command

regen:
    Arguments:
        1. filename of a options/config file?

    Flags:
        None

    Description:
        Creates all the documentation based on the config file

## Config file

Should have a bunch of values preset so that regen can create the documentation

### Configs
SourceDirectory : Is where the source files are
DocsDirectory   : Is where the docs should be located
TopNav          : This could be used to add custom links on the top navigation bar to point to other user written pieces of documentation would use a += type syntax
